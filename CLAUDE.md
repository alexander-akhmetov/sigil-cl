# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
make test    # Run all tests (SBCL, requires Quicklisp)
make load    # Compile-check: load the system without running tests
make clean   # Remove .fasl caches
```

Tests use a custom framework in `t/suite.lisp` (no external test library). Each suite is a `defun` (e.g., `run-recorder-tests`) called by `run-tests`. Add new test cases inside existing suites using `(check "label" condition)`. The `make test` output is filtered to show only pass/fail lines.

The SBCL invocation uses `--no-userinit` and loads deps via Quicklisp. Set `QUICKLISP_HOME` if your Quicklisp is not at `~/quicklisp/`.

## Architecture

Common Lisp SDK that captures LLM telemetry and exports it via two paths:
- **Generations** -- structured JSON payloads POSTed to the Sigil generation API
- **Traces** -- OTel spans POSTed to an OTLP-compatible traces endpoint

### Data flow

`Recorder` -> serialize -> enqueue -> background flush loop -> HTTP POST with retry

1. Caller creates a recorder via `start-generation`, `start-tool-execution`, or `start-embedding` (or the `with-*` macros)
2. Caller sets results/errors on the recorder
3. `recorder-end` serializes the telemetry and pushes it onto bounded queues in the client
4. A background thread (`run-flush-loop`) drains queues in batches and exports via `post-with-retry`

### Key design decisions

- **Two independent queues**: `client-generation-queue` (generation payloads) and `client-trace-queue` (OTel spans). Both are bounded and drop-oldest on overflow.
- **`*trace-context*`** (dynamic variable): `with-generation` binds this with the generation's trace-id/span-id. Child `with-tool-execution` and `with-embedding` calls read it to set their `parentSpanId`, creating the span tree.
- **Content capture modes** (`:full`, `:metadata-only`, `:metadata-with-system-prompt`): control what message content is serialized. In `:metadata-only`, message structure is preserved but text fields are empty strings and tool inputs are redacted.
- **`recorder-end :around`**: shared lifecycle logic (idempotency guard, timestamp, wake worker, metrics callback) lives in the `:around` method on the base `recorder` class. Type-specific serialization is in the primary methods.
- **`http-fn` config slot**: tests inject a lambda to capture HTTP requests instead of hitting the network.

### Module responsibilities

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `config.lisp` | `sigil-config` class, all tunables |
| `client.lisp` | `sigil-client`, background flush loop, lifecycle, recorder factory functions |
| `recorder.lisp` | Base `recorder` class, `generation-recorder`, `tool-execution-recorder`, `embedding-recorder`, serialization |
| `macros.lisp` | `with-generation`, `with-tool-execution`, `with-embedding`, `with-span` |
| `exporter.lisp` | HTTP POST with exponential backoff retry |
| `normalize.lisp` | Convert raw Anthropic/OpenAI API hash-tables into SDK CLOS types |
| `otel.lisp` | OTel attribute helpers, span/payload builders |
| `queue.lisp` | Thread-safe bounded queue (drop-oldest overflow) |
| `auth.lisp` | Build auth headers from config (basic/bearer/tenant) |
| `types.lisp` | CLOS message/part/token-usage types and constructors |

## Conventions

- JSON is built with `jobj`/`jarr`/`jget`/`jget*` helpers wrapping jzon hash-tables, not raw `make-hash-table` calls
- Package nicknames: `jzon` for `com.inuoe.jzon`, `bt2` for `bordeaux-threads-2`, `alex` for `alexandria`
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings (`iso8601-now`) or nanosecond strings (`current-unix-nano`) -- never fixnums
- Tool call `input_json` is base64-encoded in serialized output
- ASDF system loads files serially (`:serial t`); file order in the `.asd` matters
